# **Bearing-Damage-Detection-Using-Sound-Analysis**

## Description
This project features a MATLAB program designed to analyze whether a bearing is damaged based on sound analysis. By processing audio signals captured during bearing operation, the program identifies patterns and anomalies that indicate potential damage or wear.

## Features
- Sound analysis to detect anomalies and potential damage in bearings.
- Signal processing and feature extraction for accurate diagnosis.
- User-friendly interface for importing and analyzing audio samples.

## Example Output
Below is an example of the output produced by the bearing damage detection program:
